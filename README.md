The purpose of this application is to read through a csv file and remove user selected extensions from words for a specified column. 
Currently the bot is configured to identify and remove company suffixes. The list is editable by the user.
We use TKinter to build the interface for this app.
## Instructions

You may also choose to download a list of common company suffixed compiled by us, the file is named "companysuffixfile.txt"

You may also wish to build a new list manually which can be achieved through the TKinter interface.
